# TodoTones

Todo Tones is a generative music project based on "todo-lists",
more specifically todo-list coding tutorials, which are ubiquitous
as a simple way of demonstrating Create, Read, Update, and Delete
functionality. You can try it online at
[todo.toneflow.io/](https://todo.toneflow.io/)

The app uses a text-based "language" to define parameters for 
generative ambient sounds. The musical utility is limited,
but experimentation will still yield some cool sounds.
(Instructions for use are found by clicking in the upper right.)

Thanks to the inspiringly prolific Tania Rascia 
for the specific MVC tutorial that inspired this project!
